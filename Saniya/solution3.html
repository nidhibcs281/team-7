            <h2 class="heading">Pipeline Optimization in Residential Areas</h2>

            <p><strong>SDG:</strong> 11</p>
            <p><strong>Target:</strong> 11.1</p>
            <p><strong>Indicator:</strong> 11.1.1</p>

            <p><strong>You are given a dataset that represents the cost of laying pipelines between houses in a residential area. Your task is to use Kruskal's Algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), which will minimize the total cost of connecting all the houses using the pipeline.</strong></p>

            <p><strong>The edges in the graph represent the cost to lay the pipeline between two houses.</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Algorithm:</strong> Kruskal's Algorithm</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Finds the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) by sorting all edges by weight and adding them to the tree while avoiding cycles.</p>
            <p><strong>Efficiency:</strong> O(|E| log|E|)</p>
