            <p><strong>Unmanned machines like drones are crucial for delivering essential goods such as food and medicine and for providing real-time data during emergencies. They assist rescue teams by helping optimize the flow of supplies and access critical information during disaster events.</strong></p>

            <p><strong>1. Binary search Trees:</strong> Manage and organize supply routes efficiently, ensuring that no places are left unvisited. They allow efficient tracking and organization of available supplies.</p>

            <p><strong>2. Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm:</strong> Used for managing connected areas during disasters. It ensures drones can deliver supplies where necessary, efficiently grouping reachable regions to prevent redundant operations.</p>

            <p><strong>Efficiency:</strong> O(|E| log|E|) for sorting edges and connecting components.</p>

            <p><strong>3. Queues:</strong>  These ensure the machines are sent out based on priority levels, such as proximity or urgency.</p>

            <p><strong>4. DFS:</strong> Used in exploring all possible routes through disaster areas to identify the most critical places to provide immediate aid.</p>
